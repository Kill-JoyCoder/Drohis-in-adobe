Quick Start
This project can be run either with Docker (recommended for portability and consistency) or with a local Python virtual environment.
The system works fully offline, using only CPU.

1. Running with Docker (Recommended)
a. Build the Docker Image
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows) and run:

text
docker build -t docintelligence:latest .
b. Prepare Folders for Input/Output
Place your input PDF files in the pdfs/ directory at your project root.

Ensure there is an outputs/ directory for results.

c. Run in Interactive Mode (Prompts for Persona & Job)
text
docker run --rm -it -v %cd%\pdfs:/app/pdfs -v %cd%\outputs:/app/outputs docintelligence:latest
On prompt, enter:

Persona (e.g., PhD researcher in computational biology)

Job to be done (e.g., Prepare a comprehensive literature review...)

PDF file paths, comma-separated (e.g., pdfs/file1.pdf, pdfs/file2.pdf)

d. Run in CLI Argument Mode (All Info as Arguments)
text
docker run --rm -it -v %cd%\pdfs:/app/pdfs -v %cd%\outputs:/app/outputs docintelligence:latest ^
  "Persona here" "Job to be done here" pdfs/file1.pdf pdfs/file2.pdf
For multi-line in PowerShell, use ^; for Bash (Linux/Mac), use \.

e. Retrieve Output
Find JSON results in the outputs/ folder.

Files will be named:

text
extracted_persona_job_timestamp.json
Example:

text
outputs/extracted_phd_researcher_literature_review_20250728-223014.json
2. Running Without Docker (Python Virtual Environment)
a. Set Up Environment
text
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
# or: source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
b. Install Dependencies
text
pip install -r requirements.txt
c. Run the Application
With Prompts
text
python app/main.py
You will be prompted for persona, job, and PDF file paths.

With All Arguments
text
python app/main.py "Persona here" "Job to be done here" pdfs/file1.pdf pdfs/file2.pdf
3. Notes
All processing is offline (no network required).

JSON output structure matches official hackathon template.

Works for any persona, any task, and supports 3â€“10 PDFs at once.

If you experience "file not found" errors, make sure your PDF paths and folder structure match what the instructions expect.

The system auto-filters out non-informative document sections to maximize relevance.

4. Troubleshooting
File Not Found: Make sure the PDFs exist in pdfs/ and supply correct names.

Dependencies Not Installing: Ensure Python 3.10+, Docker, and pip are installed.

Output Missing: Output will be in the outputs/ directory, and filenames include persona/job/timestamp.

For any issues, consult README.md troubleshooting or contact the project owner.
